    <div style="

    margin-bottom: 1em;">HTML has had a life-span of roughly seven years. During that
    time, it has evolved from a simple language with a small number of
    tags to a complex system of mark-up, enabling authors to create
    all-singing-and-dancing Web pages complete with animated images,
    sound and all manner of gimmicks. This chapter tells you something
    about the Web's early days, HTML, and about the people, companies
    and organizations who contributed to HTML+, HTML 2, HTML 3.2
    and finally, HTML 4.</div>

<div style="

readers some idea of how the HTML we use today was developed from
the prototype written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1992. The story is
interesting - not least because HTML has been through an
extremely bumpy ride on the road to standardization, with software
engineers, academics and browser companies haggling about the
language like so many Ministers of Parliament debating in the House
of Commons.</div>

<div style="

expect it: at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in
Geneva, Switzerland. CERN is a meeting place for physicists from all
over the world, where highly abstract and conceptual thinkers engage
in the contemplation of complex atomic phenomena that occur on a
minuscule scale in time and space. This is a surprising place indeed
for the beginnings of a technology which would, eventually, deliver
everything from tourist information, online shopping and
advertisements, financial data, weather forecasts and much more to
your personal computer.</div>

    captured in the song, <div style="display: inline; font-style: italic;">The Net Flag</div>, which can be found
    `somewhere on the Internet'. The first verse runs as follows:</div>

    The people's web is deepest red,<div></div>

    But ere the bugs grew ten days old,<div></div>
    The patches fixed the broken code.</div>

    open to anyone in the engineering community: any interested computer
    scientist could potentially become a member and, once on its mailing
    list, could take part in email debate. The HTML working group met
    approximately three times a year, during which time they would enjoy
    a good haggle about HTML features present and future, be pleasantly
    suffused with coffee and beer, striding about plush hotel lobbies
    sporting pony tails, T-shirts and jeans without the slightest care.
